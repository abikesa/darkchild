Thanks for providing more specific details about the guitar riff. Let's break down the elements you've described:

1. **First Guitar Riff:**
   - Runs like a first inversion of Cmin7(2): FGBbCEbFGAb
   - Followed by an Ab chord quarter note at the end of the measure.

2. **Next Two Measures: Syncopations of G7:**
   - The syncopations likely involve rhythmic patterns and variations within the G7 chord.

3. **End of Second Measure: Second Riff:**
   - GAbGAbGFEbD
   - This riff concludes the second measure.

4. **Next Two Measures: Cmin7:**
   - The progression moves to Cmin7 for the next two measures.

5. **Return to First Riff:**
   - The first riff is reintroduced, leading back to Ab7 and G7.

Given these details, the use of the Cmin7(2) inversion and the specific notes in the riffs, especially the inclusion of Ab and G, aligns with the Phrygian flavor you mentioned earlier. The movement between Ab7, G7, and Cmin7 further supports this interpretation, creating a distinctive and potentially Phrygian-influenced tonal center in G minor.

Your detailed breakdown of the guitar riff and the harmonic progression adds depth to the understanding of this musical section. If you have any more questions or if there's a specific aspect you'd like to explore further, feel free to let me know!
