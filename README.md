2. History
   - Reverence
   - [Inference](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4395-8182)
   - Deliverence
     - Martina Viljoen's `ideology-critical framework`
     - She's designed it to give textual contraditions and `tensions` in isymbolic forms
     
3. Mode
   - Phrygian
   - [Flamenco](https://github.com/abikesa/darkchild/blob/main/wrappedup.pdf):: [Wrapped up, tangled up in you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0oU2ahAkGk)
