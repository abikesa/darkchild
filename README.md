3. Mode
   - Phrygian: Given the context you've described, where the progression includes an Ab7 chord, a G7 chord that feels like home, and a guitar riff moving through Cmin7-Ab7 before returning to G7, it's possible to interpret this section as having a Phrygian feel in the key of G minor. **The** use of the Ab7 chord, which contains the note Ab (the lowered second degree relative to G), and the movement through Cmin7-Ab7 can contribute to a Phrygian flavor. The G7 chord then serves as a resolution, creating a sense of home in the G minor tonality. **In** Phrygian mode, the lowered second degree is a distinctive feature, and your observation of a feeling akin to Phrygian, even within the context of the key with three flats, aligns with this characteristic. **Analyzing** the specific intervals and melodic elements in the guitar riff could provide further insights into the Phrygian influence. Your attention to detail in identifying these harmonic and melodic nuances is valuable for understanding the complexity of the musical passage. **If** you have more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss regarding this musical exploration, feel free to let me know!
   - [Flamenco](https://github.com/abikesa/darkchild/blob/main/wrappedup.pdf):: [Wrapped up, tangled up in you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0oU2ahAkGk)
   - p. 273-274: the elided ressolution of `ii - I` heightens the sensuous timbral and rhythmic effect (i.e., `bounce`) of the first guitar chord, prolonged in a syncopated strumming effect almost reminiscent of the `flamenco` style, and intensified also by the overall rhythmic impulse of the music
